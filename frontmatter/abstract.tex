This thesis aims at providing comparative visual literature analysis based on automatically identified storylines. Storylines consist of topics and contextual words that share a common theme and can be compared for different literature by providing similarities and differences. However, extracted storylines do not substitute the actual reading but represent a coarse overview. Therefore, in this thesis we follow the principle of overview and detail giving the user the power to interactively drill down from a generalized overview to shortened text paragraphs up to the full underlying literature.
